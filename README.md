# Terraform Plan Visualizer

This Github repository is based on the work of [Tu Nguyen](https://github.com/im2nguyen) around the visualization of the terraform plan. 

When you are in the real life and deploying large amount of resources in the cloud with terraform, it comes sometimes difficult to ensure that you plan is correct before applying it. 

The main idea of the project is to deliver a nice GUI to browse which changes will be performed before constructing your plan.

This Repo presents how to integrate the tool in you CICD pipeline with github and access to your plan in a clean GUI interface.
